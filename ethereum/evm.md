# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

-	The EVM is the part of Ethereum that handles smart contract deployment and execution. 
-	An immutable program code ROM, loaded with the bytecode of the smart contract to be executed
-	A volatile memory, with every location explicitly initialized to zero
-	A permanent storage that is part of the Ethereum state, also zero-initialized

-	The EVM Instruction Set
	-	Arithmetic and bitwise logic operations
	-	Execution context inquiries
	-	Stack, memory, and storage access
	-	Control flow operations
	-	Logging, calling, and other operators
	
-	The job of the EVM is to update the Ethereum state by computing valid state transitions as a result of smart contract code execution, as defined by the Ethereum protocol.
