# Blockchain

## **Blockchain's Componentes**
-	Peer-to-peer (P2P) network
-	Messages / Transactions (state transition)
-	Consensus rules
-	State machine (processing tranactions as per consensus rules)
-	Chain of blocks
-	Nodes 
	-	Mining node : produce blocks, huge computing resources. don't validate blocks 
	-	Full node : store the entire copy of blockchain. validate blocks that they receive, and propogate validated blocks to network
	-	Light node : don't store blockchain. store block header and very small set of transactions. doesn't validate blocks and need to trust on full nodes
	-	Web node : not nodes, wallets that connect to the centralized servers. don't store any part of blockchain. can't connect to other nodes 

## **Cryptography**
-	Symmetric Cryptography
	-	Substitution
	-	Transposition
	-	Block Cipher and Data Encryption Standard (DES)
	-	Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
	
-	Asymmetric Cryptography / Public Key Cryptography
	-	Digital Signature (Authentication)
	-	Authentication & Security
	-	RSA Algorithm
	-	**Elliptic curve cryptography**
	
-	Data Integrity (Cryptographic Hashing)
	-	Message Authentication
	-	Digital Signature
	-	Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
	
## **Ethereum**
-	Ethereumâ€™s Components
-	Decentralized Applications (DApps)
-	Ethereum Wallet
-	Ethereum networks
-	Ethereum cryptography
-	Ethereum addresses
